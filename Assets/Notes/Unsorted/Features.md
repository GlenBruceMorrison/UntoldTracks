## General Terrain

### Mountains

Will be way down the line considering how hard generation might or might not be, but more scenic elements like this bridge on the side of a mountain would be really cool, would simply have a condition if the player jumps off down to the mountain side they would die, lose all thier stuff and spawn back on the train.

## Bridges

### Canyon bridge

A big canyon that has an old fashioned railway bridge across it

Could make it more interesting like sometimes it might be broken and the player has to repair it using just wood. 

The train would have to automatically stop before it hits it and the player would not be able to continue until it's filled with the right ammount of wood.

### Random scenery bridge

Can just be a random bridge in the generation for some different scenery to look at.

## Abandoned Railway stations

These can obviously just be really simple stuff, might only even have some chests with rarer items. Or even items you can't craft and have to collect in these places. Can be build upon limitlessly with (enemies/puzzles/maybe slight horror elements) down the road. Can also have story elements dotted around when we get to that.

Would be cool to look like this but obviously much simpler

We can also just start with really simple versions

Can also maybe go underground for some biomes and would be really cool to come accross an undergroudn station
